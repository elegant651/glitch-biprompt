# DynamoNFT - AI Generative Dynamic NFT on zkEVM ðŸ”‹**

Currently, various images may be generated using AI. Using this, we created a solution that makes it easy to mint NFTs. In addition, it is possible to communicate faster than conventional layer1 by utilizing a zkRollup-based scroll network. The existing fixed form of NFT has evolved to finally implement dynamic NFTs that can freely change the generated image. Although there are still many areas to improve as MVP, it showed the initial part of the project to be carried out first.
